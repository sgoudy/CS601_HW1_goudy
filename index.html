        <h2>Hey! Welcome to my Round Pen</h2>
        <p>This is where you get to know me a little better because I don't have a say in the matter :) (a bit of horse humor).  I'm a former Marine Corps Officer. Served for a decade as an Aviator, I flew those helicopter/ plane combo things (MV-22B) for my career. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I am now enjoying civilian life even more.</p>

        <p>I decided I wanted to be able to work from home... got my <strong>MBA</strong>, and then randomly discovered software. I haven't looked back since. Surprisingly, I do find it just as (if not even more so) stimulating as flying. I love challenging my brain and cannot wait to see where I end up.</p>
         
       <p>I'm a huge gear-head and tinkerer. I love making things work so I'm hoping I could land somewhere in the <strong>automotive or aviation sector.</strong></p>

        <p>I also volunteer at a ranch up the road everyday. I find the horses to be incredibly therapeutic and LOVE the fact that I can work on my own schedule, so long as I get the work done. </p>

        <h3>Take a look around!</h3>

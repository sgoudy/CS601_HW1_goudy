      <h2>Background</h2>
      Originally from Annapolis, MD, I went to school at the oldest private military college in the U.S., Norwich University. Located in podunk Northfield, Vermont, it was the greatest life choice I ever made. Since then I've traveled to dozens of countries and seen 5 of 7 continents. I don't miss serving but I do miss my Marines and all of the incredibly unique experiences.</section>

      <h2>Favorite Deployment</h2>
      <img src="images/afghan_rex.jpg" alt="Me in camouflage with two Afghan dogs" height="300">
      <p>I served from 2009 to the last day of 2018. On my last deployment, I got to meet these dogs (and help care for them as an additional perk of the gig). Quite frankly, I think they kept me safe and more sane than I would've been had they not been there. Thanks Rex!</p>

      <h2>Favorite Part About Working from Home!</h2>

      <p>
        I shot this footage yesterday. I really enjoy being able to get my work done on my own time (be it 0400 in the morning or 7 pm) so that I can go and explore when and where I like.
